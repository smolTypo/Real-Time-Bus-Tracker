This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp

This exercise features a real-time bus tracker application that is powered by the Google Maps API and the MBTA API. The application will show the locations of buses in the area and will respond to user interactions with the map, such as zooming in or out.

## About:
The objective is to create a real-time bus tracker application by fetching live bus data from the MBTA API and animating the map to show the locations of buses in the selected area. For this project we had to sign up to get the Google Maps API key and an MBTA API key; JavaScript codes for this exercise is responsible for fetching live bus data from the MBTA API, animating the map to show the locations of buses in the area, and responding to user interactions with the map. The code first fetches the data from the MBTA API and then creates markers on the map for each bus. The code then sets up an event listener to respond to user interactions with the map, such as zooming in or out, and animates the map accordingly.
